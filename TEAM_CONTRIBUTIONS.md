## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Member 1: Yijia Kang

-   **System Architecture:** Designed the end-to-end RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.
-   **Implementation:** Wrote the core Python scripts:
    -   `data_prep.py` for data cleaning.
    -   `main.py` for the CLI engine and search logic.
    -   `app.py` for the Streamlit web interface.
-   **AI Integration:** Implemented `Sentence-BERT` for vector embeddings and `Flan-T5` for the Q&A generation.

### Member 2: Manasvi Vardham

-   **Demo Video Production:** Responsible for recording the screen capture of the software in action, editing the footage, and producing the final 2-3 minute submission video.
-   **Functional Testing:** Conducted "Black Box Testing" on the Web Interface (`app.py`) to ensure all buttons and search features work without crashing.
-   **Performance Check:** Verified that the "Similarity Score" feature displays correctly for various queries.

### Member 3: [Teammate 2 Name]

-   **Demo Scripting:** Designed the user scenarios and wrote the narration script for the demo video (e.g., selecting which specific questions to ask: *"Who announced cash dividends?"*).
-   **CLI Testing:** Tested the Command Line Interface (`main.py`) to ensure robust error handling (e.g., checking what happens when the user types 'exit' or invalid inputs).
-   **Documentation Review:** Reviewed the `README.md` to ensure the installation steps are clear and reproducible.
